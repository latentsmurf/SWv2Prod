# Mastering the Kubrick Look

Stanley Kubrick is known for his meticulous attention to detail, symmetrical compositions, and often cold, detached atmosphere. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to replicate this iconic style using SceneWeaver's AI generation tools.

## The Key Elements

To achieve a Kubrick-esque shot, you need to focus on three main pillars:

1.  **One-Point Perspective**: The camera should be placed dead center, creating a strong sense of symmetry.
2.  **High Key or Practical Lighting**: Often bright, even lighting (like in *2001: A Space Odyssey*) or practical sources (like the candles in *Barry Lyndon*).
3.  **The "Stare"**: Characters often look slightly up from beneath their eyebrows, creating an intense connection with the viewer.

## Prompting Strategy

When crafting your prompt in the **Greenlight Wizard**, try adding these keywords:

> "Symmetrical composition, one-point perspective, wide angle lens, cold color palette, clinical atmosphere, high detail."

Here is an example of a generated shot using this technique:

## Try It Yourself

## Advanced Techniques

Once you have the base look, try experimenting with **camera movement**. Kubrick was a master of the slow zoom and the steady tracking shot. In the **Production** tab, set your camera motion to "Dolly In" with a speed of "Slow" to mimic this effect.

Happy filmmaking!
